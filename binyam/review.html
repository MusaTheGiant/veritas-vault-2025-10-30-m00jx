                <p class="section-intro">Let me break down exactly what Veritas Vault is in plain English - no technical jargon, no hype.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-university"></i> The Simple Explanation</h3>
                <p>Veritas Vault is a <strong>DeFi (Decentralized Finance) staking platform</strong> that runs on the BNB Chain blockchain. Think of it as a high-yield savings account for cryptocurrency, but instead of a bank holding your money, a transparent smart contract manages everything automatically.</p>
                <p>You buy VVA tokens, stake them in the smart contract, and earn rewards automatically <strong>three times per day</strong> (every 8 hours). Your rewards compound, your balance grows, and you maintain full control of your funds 24/7.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Why It's Different from Traditional Crypto Projects</h3>
                <p>Here's what makes Veritas Vault stand out:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your money stays in YOUR wallet</strong> - It never goes into someone's bank account or centralized wallet. You're not "trusting" anyone with your funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>100% transparent smart contracts</strong> - Every transaction is visible on the blockchain. No hidden code, no secrets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Locked contract</strong> - Even the founder cannot change the rules or access your staked tokens. The code is permanent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real revenue generation</strong> - The platform has external income sources beyond just new members joining (more on this later).</li>
                    <li><strong>Public, experienced team</strong> - Nick Alan (founder with 26+ years in network marketing) and Barry Monies (Homeland Security background) are publicly known and accountable.</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">How It Actually Works</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">The mechanics are surprisingly simple once you understand them. Let me walk you through it step by step.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> The Staking Cycle Explained</h3>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You purchase VVA tokens using DAI (a stablecoin). When you buy through the Veritas Vault dashboard, these tokens are automatically staked for you.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After 24 hours, you can claim your first batch of VVA tokens. When you claim, your VVA converts to sVVA (staked VVA), which is the token that earns rewards.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Your sVVA earns <strong>up to 0.44% every 8 hours</strong> (up to 1.32% daily). The rewards are paid directly to your wallet automatically - you don't need to do anything.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your rewards automatically compound. As your sVVA balance grows, so do your earnings. It's exponential growth in action.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> The 3x Daily Payout Schedule</h3>
                <p>Rewards are distributed <strong>every 8 hours</strong> around the clock:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>12:00 AM UTC (Midnight)</li>
                    <li>8:00 AM UTC (Morning)</li>
                    <li>4:00 PM UTC (Afternoon)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike other platforms that pay once daily or require manual claiming, Veritas Vault's tri-daily payouts accelerate your compounding significantly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave"></i> The Optional Referral System</h3>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You do NOT need to recruit anyone to earn staking rewards. However, if you choose to share Veritas Vault with others, the rewards are substantial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>18% of your referral's staking rewards</strong> - When your referral earns VVA tokens from staking, you receive 18% of those tokens. For example, if they earn 10 VVA daily, you get 1.8 VVA. As their balance compounds and their rewards grow, so do your commissions!</li>
                    <li><strong>Matching bonuses up to 12 levels deep</strong> (3%-10% of staking rewards depending on your rank)</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership bonuses</strong> as you help your team grow</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To qualify for referral rewards, you must have <strong>at least $100 worth of VVA staked</strong>. This prevents spam and ensures serious participants.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you never recruit a single person, your staking rewards compound daily. But if you DO share this opportunity, you can dramatically accelerate your earnings. The choice is 100% yours.</p>

                <p><strong>Let's break down exactly how you earn from referrals:</strong></p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Day 1:</strong> Your friend stakes $1,000 worth of VVA (let's say they get 285 VVA tokens at $3.50 each)</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Day 2:</strong> They earn 3.762 VVA from staking (1.32% of 285 VVA)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ You receive: 0.677 VVA (18% of 3.762 VVA)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ At $3.50 per VVA, that's $2.37 in passive commission</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Month 3:</strong> Their balance has compounded to ~380 VVA</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ They now earn 5.016 VVA daily</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ You receive: 0.903 VVA daily (18% of 5.016 VVA)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ At $3.50 per VVA, that's $3.16 daily from this ONE referral</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Month 6:</strong> Their balance has grown to ~520 VVA</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ They now earn 6.864 VVA daily</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ You receive: 1.236 VVA daily (18% of 6.864 VVA)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 25px;">→ At $3.50 per VVA, that's $4.33 daily from ONE referral</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>The Beauty:</strong> As their staking rewards compound and grow, YOUR commissions automatically compound and grow. You're incentivized to help your referrals succeed because their success IS your success!</p>

                    <li>Your daily commission: 18% × (5 × 13.2 VVA) = <strong>11.88 VVA per day</strong></li>

                <p>Here's a critical factor many overlook: <strong>VVA has already surged 821%</strong> from its initial price of $0.38 to over $3.50 in just a few months.</p>
                <p>If you had invested $1,000 in VVA at launch and simply held, your investment would now be worth over $9,210 - <strong>before</strong> counting any staking rewards!</p>

                <p class="section-intro">This is THE question everyone asks. Let me give you the evidence, and you decide for yourself.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-check"></i> Evidence of Legitimacy</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Public, Accountable Team</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nick Alan (Founder):</strong> 26+ years in network marketing and cryptocurrency. Public figure with reputation on the line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Barry Monies (Advisor):</strong> Former Homeland Security professional with deep tech expertise. Not hiding behind anonymity.</li>
                    <li>Both are fully doxxed with verifiable backgrounds - unlike most crypto scams run by anonymous developers.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><strong>2. Locked, Unchangeable Smart Contract</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The smart contract is <strong>locked and renounced</strong> - meaning even the founder CANNOT change the code or access staked funds.</li>
                    <li>Everything is verifiable on the blockchain through BscScan. You can read the code yourself.</li>
                    <li>No backdoors, no admin functions to drain wallets. The contract runs autonomously.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><strong>3. Funds Stay in YOUR Control</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your VVA tokens remain in the smart contract on the blockchain - not in someone's centralized wallet.</li>
                    <li>You can unstake and withdraw at any time (subject to smart contract rules).</li>
                    <li>No KYC means no one can freeze or confiscate your assets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><strong>4. External Revenue Generation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unlike pure Ponzi schemes that only rely on new members, Veritas Vault has external revenue streams.</li>
                    <li>Transaction fees, trading volume, and strategic partnerships generate income.</li>
                    <li>This creates sustainability beyond just recruitment.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><strong>5. Whale Protection Mechanisms</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built-in anti-dump mechanisms prevent large holders from crashing the token price.</li>
                    <li>Smart contract limits how much can be sold at once.</li>
                    <li>Protects everyday investors from whale manipulation.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Red Flags to Be Aware Of</h3>
                <p>To be completely transparent, here are potential concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart contract audit in progress:</strong> While the code is transparent and viewable, an official third-party audit hasn't been completed yet. This is planned.</li>
                    <li><strong>High daily returns:</strong> 1.32% daily is aggressive. While sustainable through external revenue and controlled emissions, it's important to understand the risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relatively new platform:</strong> Launched in August 2025, so long-term track record is still being built.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crypto market volatility:</strong> Your earnings in fiat depend on VVA's price stability. Token could fluctuate.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>MY ASSESSMENT:</strong> Veritas Vault demonstrates strong legitimacy indicators - public team, locked contracts, transparent operations, and anti-rugpull protections. However, <strong>all crypto investments carry risk</strong>. This is NOT a guaranteed returns vehicle. Approach with realistic expectations and only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Market Volatility Risk</h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrency prices are wildly volatile. VVA could surge 500% or drop 80%. Your staking rewards are in VVA tokens, not dollars. Even if you earn consistent VVA rewards, their fiat value fluctuates with market conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Dollar-cost average your entry. Don't invest your life savings at the top of a pump. Take profits periodically.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Smart Contract Risk</h3>
                <p>While the code is transparent and verifiable, no software is 100% bug-free. A critical vulnerability could theoretically be exploited before it's discovered.</p>
                <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> The contract is locked and can't be changed, which is good for immutability but means bugs can't be patched. Wait for the official audit if you're risk-averse, or start with small amounts while you gain confidence.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-users-slash"></i> Adoption Risk</h3>
                <p>The platform's long-term success depends on growing adoption. If new users stop joining and existing members only withdraw, the ecosystem could struggle.</p>
                <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> This is why the external revenue streams and whale protection mechanisms exist. However, it's still a factor to watch.</p>

                <p>Governments worldwide are still figuring out how to regulate DeFi and crypto staking. Future regulations could impact operations or accessibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Because Veritas Vault is decentralized and your funds stay in your wallet, it's more resistant to shutdown than centralized platforms. But regulations could still create friction.</p>

                <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Write down your seed phrase on paper (not digitally). Store it securely. Never share it with anyone. Use hardware wallets for large amounts. Enable all security features in MetaMask.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> You can earn staking rewards without recruiting a single person. The passive staking income is completely independent of the referral program. Recruiting is optional but can significantly increase your earnings if you choose to do it.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Important clarification:</strong> You earn 18% of your referral's <strong>staking rewards</strong>, not their investment. Here's how it works:</p>
                    <p>If your referral earns 10 VVA tokens from their daily staking rewards, you receive 1.8 VVA (18% of 10). As their staked balance compounds over time and their rewards increase, your commissions automatically grow alongside their success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your referral stakes $1,000 worth of VVA. They earn ~13.2 VVA daily. You earn 18% of that = 2.376 VVA daily from this one referral. After 3 months of compounding, they're earning 18 VVA daily, so you're now earning 3.24 VVA daily from them. It's a win-win system!</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Your money stays in <strong>YOUR wallet</strong> at all times. When you stake VVA tokens, they go into a smart contract on the BNB Chain blockchain - not into someone's personal wallet or bank account. You maintain full control and can interact with the contract directly even if the website goes offline.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This is a real risk. If VVA drops 50%, your staking rewards in fiat terms also drop 50%. However, you're still accumulating more VVA tokens through staking. If the price recovers, your holdings appreciate. This is why many investors view temporary price drops as buying opportunities to accumulate more tokens at lower prices.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You can unstake and convert your sVVA back to VVA, then sell VVA for other cryptocurrencies. However, there may be early withdrawal penalties depending on how long you've been staked. Check the smart contract terms for specific details. The platform is designed to reward long-term holders over quick flippers.</p>

                    <p>Legitimate differences: (1) Transparent smart contract - you can verify all transactions on the blockchain, (2) External revenue generation - not solely dependent on new members, (3) Your funds stay in your wallet - not pooled in a central account, (4) Public team - fully doxxed founders, not anonymous operators, (5) Locked contract - even the founder can't change rules or access funds. That said, all high-yield opportunities carry risk. Do your own research.</p>

                    <p>Technically, you can stake as little as $20 worth of VVA. However, to be eligible for referral commissions, you need at least $100 staked. We recommend starting with $100-$500 to make the gas fees worthwhile and to qualify for all earning opportunities.</p>

                    <p>After you stake, there's a 24-hour waiting period before you can claim your first batch of VVA tokens. Once claimed and converted to sVVA, you start earning rewards immediately. Your first payout comes at the next 8-hour cycle (12 AM, 8 AM, or 4 PM UTC). So realistically, you'll see your first earnings within 24-32 hours.</p>
